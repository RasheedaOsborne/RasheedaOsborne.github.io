	<h2>Step One</h2>
    <div class="wrapper">
     <img src= "img/tableplan.jpg">
    

	   <h3>Create a table plan.</h3>
	     <p>Before you go out looking for the things you will need, the first thing you will want to do it draw the way you would want your table to decorated. By doing a table you are also able to save time when it is time to start decorating the table because you will already know where things are suppose to place. The table might change if you on able to get the correct object or if a one object does not work with the aesthetic of the table.</p>
    </div>

	<h2>Step Two</h2>
	<div class="wrapper">
	 <img src="img/storage.jpg">
	  <ul>
        <img src= "img/storage2.jpg">
        <img src= "img/storage3.jpg">
        <img src= "img/storage4.jpg">
       </ul>

	   <h3>Find decorations in storage.</h3>
	     <p>Before you go out shopping for Halloween stuff and spending any money on decorations, look for any decorations in your storage room because you may find something you need for your table and also avoid buying something you already have.</p>
    </div>

	<h2>Step Three</h2>
	<div class="wrapper">
	 <img src="img/list.jpg">
	  
	   <h3>Make a list.</h3>
	     <p>Make a list of the things you will need to buy so you do not spend extra money on things you may not need. Making list can also help save if you are in a rush to get things because you go in to get the stuff on the list and then you are out.</p>
	</div>


	<h2>Step Four</h2>
	 <div class="wrapper">
	 <img src="img/shopping.jpg">
	  <ul>
        <img src= "img/shopping2.jpg">
        <img src= "img/shopping3.jpg">
        <img src= "img/shopping4.jpg">
       </ul>
	   <h3>Time to shop.</h3>
	     <p>Now that you have your list of decorations you need to buy, it is time for you to actually go to the stores and buy the things you will need. Some stores I recommend you going to is Michael's because they have good arts and crafts supplies and you will have better luck finding halloween things there. Another store would be Party City because it is a party store and right now it is the Halloween season so you will be able to find a lot of Halloween decorations there.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Step Five</h2>
	<div class="wrapper">
	 <img src="img/decorate4.jpg">
	  <ul>
        <img src= "img/decorate2.jpg">
        <img src= "img/decorate3.jpg">
        <img src= "img/decorate5.jpg">
       </ul>
	   <h3>Time for decorating!</h3>
	     <p>Now that you have set up a table plan and found and bought the stuff that you need, it is time for decorating. Following your table plan you can now set up your table. Note: SO that way you do not have a huge mess to clean up afterwards, have a trash bag hanging near your table so that way you keep throwing trash in there and not on the floor.</p>
    </div>

	<h2>Step Six</h2>
    <div class="wrapper">
	 <img src="img/finalpiece.jpg">
	  <ul>
        <img src= "img/finalpiece2.jpg">
        <img src= "img/finalpiece4.jpg">
        <img src= "img/finalpiece3.jpg">
       </ul>
	   <h3>Enjoy your table.</h3>
	     <p>Now that you have finished your Halloween table, it can know be the attraction to whatever function you plan on having in your home such as a rocking Costume party or a haunted house.</p>
